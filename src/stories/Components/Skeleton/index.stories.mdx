# Skeleton

`Skeleton` screens are blank pages that are progressively populated with content, such as text and images, as they become available.

`Skeleton` components provide a nice user experience while the application is initially loaded. Because users can predict the layout of your application through the `Skeleton` while the content is loading.

`Skeleton` in Quantumic Design is using pure CSS not SVG, so you can customize easily your own skeleton component with CSS.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Skeleton">
    <Flex direction="column">
      <Skeleton width={50} height={50} type="circle" />
      <Spacing size={10} />
      <Skeleton width={100} height={20} />
    </Flex>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```tsx
<Skeleton width={50} height={50} type="circle" />
<Spacing size={10} />
<Skeleton width={100} height={20} />
```
