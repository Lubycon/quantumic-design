# Spacing

`Spacing` component is used when you want to create margins between elements.

Maybe your components would have designed to focus to control some business related states, and render it. In this cases, spacing is not the responsibility of your component.

Now you can delegate this responsibility to `Spacing` component and your custom components can just focus to handle states.

```tsx
<div />
<Spacing size={10} />
<div />
<Spacing size={10} />
<div />
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Spacing">
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>
      <Box color="#f783ac" />
      <Spacing size={10} />
      <Box color="#da77f2" />
      <Spacing size={10} />
      <Box color="#9775fa" />
    </div>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
