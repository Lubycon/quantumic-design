# Quantumic Design

Quantumic Design is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based UI Kit that consists of some tiny components, functions and react hooks.

Most of components in Quantumic Design is designed that have single responsibility. So you can assemble these quantumic components to make your own design system more faster. Or just use these are.

## Quick start

Quantumic Design package is published on npm registry. So you can install this with `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
$ npm install quantumic-design
// or
$ yarn add quantumic-design
```

And add Quantumic Design Context to your application.

```tsx
// App.tsx

import React, { PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
import { QDProvider } from 'quantumic-design';

function App({ children }: PropsWithChildren<{}>) {
  return <QDProvider>{children}</QDProvider>;
}
```

Quantumic Design never affect anything already implemented in your application.

Even if `QDProvider` is added to your app, Quantumic Design never affect anything already implemented in your application.

In other words, it does not include features to normalize or initialize like `normalize.css`, `reset.css` or polyfills. If you need to do these things, you have to implement these on yourself.

## With TypeScript

Quantumic Design is TypeScript and React based library. Therefore, Quantumic Design provides its own type declarations, so you don't need to install additional typing packages like `@types/quantumic-design`.
